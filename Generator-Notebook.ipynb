    "There exist a variety of different models that can be used to generate synthetic data. On a basic level we distinguish between deterministic and random models. Deterministic models may seem appealing at first due to their simplistic nature and lack of randomness. However, real structures usually exhibit microscopic heterogeneity that cannot be captured by deterministic models.\n",

    "One the most commonly encountered classes of random models are called 'germ-grain' models. In line with their name, they can be decomposed into two separate processes. Initially, points/positions (germs) are sampled in space. For each sampled germ a corresponding body (grain) is sampled and attached to the germ. In the following, we want to test out this procedure on a simple example:\n",

    "\n",
    "With a selected shape, we need to specify the exact dimensions of the particles we want to generate. The first option to select is a distribution for the size parameters of the shapes. This option ``particle_distribution`` can be set to ``'Constant'`` or ``'Uniform'`` and describes if particles should be the same or if sizes may be sampled uniformly from a specified interval $[r_\\min,r_\\max]$. For a general purpose, we specify the size parameters as a 3x2 ``np.array``. Each row corresponds to the upper and lower bounds of an interval. In case of a constant distribution of particle size, the second column will be ignored. Depending on the particle shape, a different amount of parameters is required:\n",
    "* For ``'Sphere'`` the first row describes the radius.\n",
    "* For ``'Cube'`` the first row describes the side-length.\n",
    "* For ``'Cylinder'`` the first row describes the radius. The second row encodes the height. \n",
    "* For ``'Ellipsoid'`` the rows describe the length of the semi-axes, i.e., half-length of the main axes, in x-,y- and z-direction.\n",
    "* For ``'Cuboid'`` the rows describe the side-lengths in x-,y- and z-direction.\n",
