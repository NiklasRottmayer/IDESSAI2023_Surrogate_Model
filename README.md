## Prerequisites
For running code, you require a python environment. If you do not have a working environment yet, we recommend you to install and use anaconda. 
The working environment can either be set up manually according to their documentation (see anaconda webpage) or by installing it directly from the yml-file in this repository.
All necessary packages should be installed automatically with it.
